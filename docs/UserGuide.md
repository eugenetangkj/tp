## Introducing InternBuddy

InternBuddy is a desktop application for Computing undergraduates to manage their internship applications.
It is optimized for typing where it allows you to complete internship management tasks much more efficiently via
the keyboard as compared to using traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications. If you are a fast typist
who is seeking for a one-stop platform to systematically organise your internship applications,
then InternBuddy is the perfect buddy to accompany you during your internship hunt.

InternBuddy runs using Java 11, and is available on the Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.

## Command Information

### Notes about Commands and Parameters

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. If the command format is `add n/COMPANY_NAME`, you may input the command as `add n/Apple` where you supply the
  value `Apple` to the parameter `COMPANY_NAME`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. If the command format is `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [c/COMMENT]`, you may input the command as `edit 2 n/Apple` where
  you omit the value for the parameter `COMMENT`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. If the command format is `n/NAME r/ROLE`, both `n/Apple r/Software Engineer` and `r/Software Engineer n/Apple`
  are acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. If the command format is `r/ROLE`, typing in `r/Front-end Developer r/Back-end Developer` will cause your
  input to be interpreted as `r/Back-end Developer`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, and `exit`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. If the command format is `help`, typing in `help 123` will cause your input to be interpreted as `help`.


### Descriptions, Prefixes and Constraints for Parameters
In InternBuddy's commands, we refer to a range of parameters that you can replace with values to input information that
is customised to your internship applications.

There are 2 important things that you should note:
1. Most parameters have associated **prefixes**. Prefixes are convenient shorthands that allow you to easily identify
   which parameter does a value belong to. For example, in `add n/Apple`, the value `Apple` is associated with the
   parameter `COMPANY_NAME` since the `n/` prefix is used.
2. There are **constraints** to the values that you can replace parameters with. The constraints differ based on
   the parameters. If you do not adhere to these constraints in your input, your input will be valid and an error
   message will be shown in the Results Display when you type the input in and press <button>Enter</button>.


Figure 4 provides a summary of the parameters with their descriptions, prefixes and constraints.

| Parameter      | Description                                                                    | Prefix | Constraints                                                                                                                                             |

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 5: Parameters with their descriptions, prefixes and constraints</p>

### Details on **`STATUS`** and **`DATE`**
The parameter `STATUS` is used to represent the current status of an internship application. It can only take on one
of the following values: `New`, `Applied`, `Assessment`, `Interview`, `Offered`, `Accepted` and `Rejected`.
Note that this is not case-sensitive. Figure 6 explains the meaning of each status.


| `STATUS` | Description                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `New`             | You have recently saw this internship opportunity and would like to record it in InternBuddy. Also, you have yet to apply for it. |
| `Applied`         | You have applied for this internship opportunity and you are currently waiting for the company's response.                        |
| `Assessment`      | You are currently in the technical assessment stage of the application process.                                                   |
| `Interview`       | You are currently in the behavioral interview stage of the application process.                                                   |
| `Offered`         | You have been offered the internship opportunity.                                                                                 |
| `Accepted`        | You have accepted the internship opportunity.                                                                                     |

Depending on the status of the internship application, the `DATE` parameter will be interpreted differently. Figure 7
documents the meaning of `DATE` with respect to each `STATUS` value.

## Features

### Listing all internship entries : `list`

Shows a list of all internship entries that have been added into InternBuddy.

Format: `list`

* The meaning of the date displayed for each internship entry will depend on the status of the internship. For example, if
the status of the internship is `new`, the `date` field refers to the deadline of application. A full reference table is
shown below.

### Adding an internship entry: `add`

Adds a new internship entry to the list of existing entries.

Format: `add n/COMPANY_NAME r/ROLE s/STATUS d/DATE`
- The `STATUS` field  must have one of the following values: `new`, `applied`,
  `assessment`, `interview`, `offered` or `rejected`.
- The meaning of `DATE` would be interpreted with respect to the value of `STATUS`.


| Status       | Interpretation of Date       |

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the internship entry at the specified `INDEX`.

Example:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd internship entry in InternBuddy.

### Editing an internship entry : `edit`

Edits an internship entry from the list of existing entries.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/COMPANY_NAME] [r/ROLE] [s/STATUS ] [d/DATE]`

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* `STATUS` must have one of the following values: `new`, `applied`, `assessment`, `interview`, `offered` or `rejected`.

Examples:
